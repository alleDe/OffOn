How to Tame Your Anticipatory Algorithm

Given an arbitrary anticipatory algorithm, we present three methods that allow to retain its solution quality at a fraction of the online computational cost, via a substantial degree of offline preparation. 

Our approaches are obtained by combining: 
1) a simple technique to identify likely future outcomes based on past observations
2) the (expensive) offline computation of a “contingency table”
3) an efficient solution-fixing heuristic

We ground our techniques on two case studies: an energy management system with uncertain renewable generation and load demand, and a traveling salesman problem with uncertain travel times.
